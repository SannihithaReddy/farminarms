    <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">About Rice </h4>
    <p>	Oryza Sativa, it is believed, is associated with wet, humid climate,
         though it is not a tropical plant. 
        It is probably a descendent of wild grass that was most likely cultivated in the foothills of the far Eastern Himalayas. 
        Another school of thought believes that the rice plant may have originated in southern India, then spread to the north of
         the country and then onwards to China.
         It then arrived in Korea, the Philippines (about 2000 B. C.) and then Japan and Indonesia (about 1000 B. C.).The journey of 
         rice around the world has been slow, but once it took root it 
         stayed and became a major agriculture and economic product for the people. In the Indian subcontinent more than a quarter of the 
         cultivated land is given to rice (20011-12). It is a very essential part of the daily meal in the southern and eastern parts of 
         India. 
         In the northern and central parts of the subcontinent, where wheat is frequently eaten, rice holds its own and is cooked daily 
         as well as on festivals and special occasions.</p>
    
    <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Climatic Requirements </h4>
     
     <p >
     Once in the Farmersâ€™ Portal, a farmer will be able to get all relevant information on specific subjects around 
     his village/block /district or state.This information will be delivered in the form of text, SMS in the language
      he or she understands. These levels can be easily reached through the Map of Telangana placed on the Home page.
       Farmers will also be able to ask specific queries as well as give valuable feedback through the Feedback module
        specially developed for the purpose.</p>

        
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Nutritional Value </h4>
     
     <p >
        Rice is a nutritional staple food which provides instant energy as its most important component is carbohydrate (starch).
         On the other hand, rice is poor in nitrogenous substances with average composition of these substances being only 8 per
          cent and fat content or lipids only negligible, i.e., 1per cent and due to this reason it is considered as a complete
           food for eating. Rice flour is rich in starch and is used for making various food materials. It is also used in some 
           instances by brewers to make alcoholic malt. Likewise, rice straw mixed with other materials is used to produce
            porcelain, glass and pottery. Rice is also used in manufacturing of paper pulp and livestock bedding.The
             variability of composition and characteristics of rice is really broad and depends on variety and environmental
              conditions under which the crop is grown. In husked rice, protein content ranges in between 7per cent to 12per cent.
               The use of nitrogen fertilizers increases the percentage content of some amino acids.</p>

               <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Crop Production Practices </h4>
    <p>
        In India Rice is mainly grown in two types of soils i.e., (i) uplands and (ii) low lands.
         The method of cultivation of rice in a particular region depends largely on factors such as situation of land, 
         type of soils, irrigation facilities, availability of labourers intensity and distribution of rainfalls. 
         The crop of rice is grown with the following methods
        Dry or Semi-dry upland cultivation
        Broadcasting the seedSowing the seed behind the plough or drillingWet or lowland cultivation
        Transplanting in puddled fields.Broadcasting sprouted seeds in puddled fields
    </p>

    <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Selection of Seeds </h4>
    <p>
        The use of quality seeds in cultivation of rice is an important factor to get better crop yield.
         Therefore, proper care has to be taken in selecting seeds of the best quality. Much of the success
          in raising the healthy seedlings depends on the quality of seed. Seeds intended for sowing should
           satisfy the following requirements
        The seed should belong to the proper variety, which is proposed to be grown.The seed should be clean and free
        from obvious mixtures of other seeds.The seed should be mature, well developed and plump in size.The seed 
        should be free from obvious signs of age or bad storage.The seed should have a high germinating capacity.
        Before sowing the seed should be treated with fungicides which protects the seed against soil-born fungi 
       and also give a boost to the seedlings.
